# Rule-Based-Segmentation
In this project, new level-based customer definitions (persona) and segments are created according to these new customer definitions based on the customer data of a game company. According to these created segments, it is estimated how much new customers can earn on average.

## Dataset
The persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction

### _persona.csv_
**PRICE**   : Customer spend amount <br/>
**SOURCE**  : The type of device the customer is connecting to <br/>
**SEX**     : Customer's gender <br/>
**COUNTRY** : Customer's country <br/>
**AGE**     : Customer's age <br/>
